* emacs-clojure
A rapid setup for getting the basic clojure environment setup with necessaries and niceties including 
- use-package
- Cider
- Magit
- Helm
- Company
- SmartParens
- Projectile
- Rainbow*
- Hydra

** To Use
Assuming you have the latest emacs installed (25.*), put the included emacs.el in your home root (=~/=) directory. Upon starting emacs the first start will download all the plugins. If it doesn't read the configuration file, try renaming it to =~/.emacs= instead of emacs.el.
